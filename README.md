# Random_password
This is project basically suggest me the different password 
while working on this project i have learned, what is document.execCommand() and how to use it for copying the text which is placed in placeholder.
and its logic of genrating a random password is little bit confusing but yes it not as tougha i thoud  i have taken the hlep from google.
THE LOGIC--> 1-first create s tring which contains all the alpabets in uppercase and lowercase as weel as numbers & some unique sign like hashtag, dollar sign,
2-use the property to get the length of the string 
3-use for loop 8 times if you want to get password of 8 characters
4-use some maths function like math.floor & math.random()
4-math.floor(Math.floor(Math.random() * length) this will pick a random integer number fromm 0 to the number of characters present in the string 
6-then use the CharAt function to get the string which is present at that specific number tahat has been generated nyr math.Random()
7-keep storing the value of in a seprate variale everytime the loop runs we wil get a new character
